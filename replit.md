## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom AK Party brand colors
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Stateless JWT-based authentication

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client and server code in the same repository with shared schema
- **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend, backend, and shared code
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable UI components following atomic design principles
- **Role-Based Access**: Three distinct user roles with different permissions and UI experiences

## Key Components

### User Roles and Permissions
1. **Genel Sekreterlik (genelsekreterlik)**: Full system access including user management, question management, feedback viewing, and system logs
2. **Genel Başkan (genelbaskan)**: Can view reports and system logs, access all table responses
3. **Moderatör (moderator)**: Table-specific access to assigned questions, can create/edit answers and send feedback

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Authentication and role management
- **Tables**: Organization units for moderators
- **Questions**: Can be general (all tables) or specific (assigned tables)
- **Answers**: Multiple answers per question per table
- **Feedback**: Moderator feedback to administrators
- **Activity Logs**: System activity tracking

### Authentication System
- TC Kimlik Numarası (Turkish ID) based login
- JWT token authentication with 24-hour expiration
- Role-based route protection
- Activity logging for all user actions

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters TC number and password
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage for subsequent requests
4. Middleware validates token on protected routes

### Question Management Flow
1. Genel Sekreterlik creates questions (general or table-specific)
2. Questions distributed to appropriate moderators
3. Moderators provide multiple answers per question
4. Administrators can view all responses and generate reports

### Feedback System
1. Moderators can send feedback about questions
2. Feedback includes context about unclear questions or missing information
3. AdminPro users can view and manage feedback

- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact with static file serving

### Environment Configuration

- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (fallback provided)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Database Setup
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
